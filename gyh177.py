People in the field saw the fox.They shoutedï¼š"Look,look!The fox is carrying our cock away.''

The cock said to the fox,"Mr Fox,do you understand?The people say you are carrying their cock away.Tell them it is yours.Not theirs.''

The fox opened his mouth and said,"The cock is mine,not yours.''Just then the cock ran away from the fox and fled into the tree.
