Long long ago, there was a shepherd boy who grazed sheep on a hill everyday.
One day the boy felt a little lonely and wanted to make fun of the farmers laboring at the foot of the hill. So he climbed up a big stone, and shouted:"wolves have come! wolves have come!"
In a minute, the farmers came only to find there were no wolves at all. Seeing the farmers were taken in, the boy laughed and said, ¡®I am just joking, Don't take it seriously.¡¯ Then the farmers shook their head and left.
A few days later, the farmers heard the boy shout again. So they ran up the hill and found that they were cheated again. Another day, several wolves really came. The boy was frightened and cried out: ¡® help! Wolves have come!¡± But this time, no one came.
