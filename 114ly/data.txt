There are 6 Disneylands in the world, they are in Florida, California, France, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Shanghai. I went to Hong Kong Disneyland two years ago. The moment I stepped into this wonderful theme park, I was so attracted by its lively atmosphere. The cartoon characters were saying hello to the visitors and the music sounded so great. I took many pictures with the princesses. They were so beautiful.

Walt Disney created Mickey Mouse when he worked with his friends in the old building. They saw mice in and out, so he came the idea that he drew a cartoon mouse. It stood like a human and wore white gloves in its hand. Children loved this cartoon image so much that Walt Disney started his career successfully.
沃尔特迪斯尼创造了米老鼠，当他和他的朋友们在古老的建筑里面工作的时候。他们看见老鼠进进出出，所以他有了一个想法，他画了一只卡通老鼠。它站起来就像人类一样，戴着白色的手套。孩子们喜欢这个卡通形象，迪士尼成功开始了他的职业生涯。
